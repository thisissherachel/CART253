ACTIVITY

Make a juggling simulation!

The user will control a rectangular “paddle” at the bottom of the screen, moving it horizontally with the mouse position.
Balls will fall from the top of the screen. If they hit the paddle, they will bounce upward and fall again. If they miss the paddle, they will disappear off the bottom.

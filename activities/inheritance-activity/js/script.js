ACTIVITY

Here is a suggested plan:

1. Write a main script with states
2. Create a basic Pedestrian class and integrate it into the main script
3. Create a Vehicle class
4. Create Car, Truck, and Motorcycle classes that extend the Vehicle class
5. Add cars, trucks, and motorcycles to the main script
6. Add success and failure conditions

The user will control a circular pedestrian at the bottom of the canvas. Cars, trucks, and motorcycles will be moving left and right across the canvas.
If the pedestrian collides with any of the vehicles, they die. If they make it to the other side, they succeeded. Just like life!
